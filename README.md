# 51-Android

## Introduction 

If you're developing on Ubuntu Linux, you need to add a udev rules file that contains a USB configuration for each type of device you want to use for development. In the rules file, each device manufacturer is identified by a unique vendor ID, as specified by the ATTR{idVendor} property.

1. Open the console to copy the file "51-android.rules" to "**/etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules**" by executing the command below. To Achieve it，you should be sure that you have the **root** permission.

```bash
sudo curl --create-dirs -L -o /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules -O -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snowdream/51-android/master/51-android.rules
```

2. To give it appropriate permissions next execute the command:

```bash
sudo chmod a+r /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules
```

3. Then execute：

```bash
sudo service udev restart
```

4.When plugged in over USB, can verify that your device is connected by executing `adb devices` from your SDK platform-tools/ directory. If connected, you'll see the device name listed as a "device."
